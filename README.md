# State of art prefix fuzzy autocompletion

Improved implementation over original paper.

See [math](./topk_search.typ) in Typst.

The time complexity is dependent on the active matching set, and the size of tree overall, which doesn't explode as you type in longer strings.

## Testing 

Tracing flags from `INFO` to `TRACING` can enable code paths for self verification during algorithm execution.
